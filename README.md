# Kaggle-Data-Scientist-Salary-Classification
Kaggle hosted an open data scientist competition in 2019 titled “2019 Kaggle ML& DS Survey Challenge.” The purpose of this challenge was to “tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.” 


Through this analysis, we attempt to 
1) understand and explore employment in the data science community, as represented in a survey conducted by Kaggle.
2) train, validate, and tune multi-class ordinary classification problem that can classify, given a set of survey responses by a data scientist, what a survey respondent’s current yearly compensation bucket is.
