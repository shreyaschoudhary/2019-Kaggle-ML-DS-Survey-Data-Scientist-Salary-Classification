# Kaggle-Data-Scientist-Salary-Classification
Kaggle has hosted an open data scientist competition in 2019 titled “2019 Kaggle ML &amp; DS Survey Challenge.” The original dataset (multiple_choice_responses.csv) contains the survey results provided by Kaggle. The survey results from 19717 participants are shown in 246 columns, representing survey questions. Not all questions are answered by each participant, and responses contain various data types. The purpose of this challenge was to “tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration.”
